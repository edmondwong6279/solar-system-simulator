# Simple solar system simulation

Incredibly rough approximation of the solar system (not to scale at all). Practising use of threejs and cannon-es.

## Running the application:
Developed using node 16.17.1.

```yarn install```

```yarn build```

```yarn start```

## To do:
1. Background image is very large, either optimise or create loading screen that pauses until all assets are loaded in.
2. Check the maths used to make sure the movement is correct and that it is only the rendered sizes that are scaled up.
3. Add a timeslider to increase time.
